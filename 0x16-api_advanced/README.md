Reading API Documentation to Find Endpoints:

Understand the API's Structure: Look for sections that outline the API's endpoints, methods, and parameters.
Authentication: Check if authentication is required and what type of authentication method is used.
Search or Filter: If the documentation is extensive, use the search function to find specific endpoints related to your needs.
Categories or Tags: Some API documentation categorize endpoints into sections or tags, making it easier to navigate.
Sample Requests and Responses: Pay attention to sample requests and responses to understand how to interact with the API.
Using an API with Pagination:

Identify Pagination Parameters: Look for parameters in the documentation related to pagination, such as page and per_page.
Looping Through Pages: Make successive API requests, adjusting the pagination parameters to retrieve subsequent pages until all data is fetched.
Handle Rate Limits: Be mindful of rate limits set by the API provider and implement strategies to avoid hitting them, such as adding delays between requests.
Parsing JSON Results from an API:

Deserialize JSON: Use built-in or third-party libraries to deserialize JSON responses into usable data structures in your programming language.
Accessing Data: Navigate through the JSON structure using keys or indices to access the specific data you need.
Error Handling: Implement error handling to handle cases where the JSON structure might not match your expectations or if there are issues with the API response.
Making a Recursive API Call:

Define Recursive Function: Write a function that makes the API call and handles the response.
Base Case: Determine the condition under which the recursion should stop (e.g., reaching a certain depth, fetching all available data).
Call API: Inside the recursive function, make the API call and process the response.
Recursion: Based on the response, decide whether to make another API call or stop the recursion.
Error Handling: Implement error handling to handle any issues that might occur during the recursive process.
Sorting a Dictionary by Value:

Convert Dictionary to List of Tuples: Convert the dictionary into a list of tuples where each tuple contains the key-value pair.
Sorting: Use the sorted() function, specifying the key parameter to sort based on values.
Example (Python):
python
Copy code
my_dict = {'a': 3, 'b': 1, 'c': 2}
sorted_tuples = sorted(my_dict.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
sorted_dict = dict(sorted_tuples)
print(sorted_dict)  # Output: {'b': 1, 'c': 2, 'a': 3}
This sorts the dictionary based on values in ascending order.
