URL (Uniform Resource Locator): A URL is a web address that specifies the location of a resource on the internet. It typically consists of a protocol identifier (e.g., "http" or "https"), a domain name (e.g., "example.com"), and a path to the specific resource.

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): HTTP is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web. It is a protocol for transferring hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands.

How to read a URL:

Scheme: The protocol used (e.g., http, https).
Domain: The unique address of a website.
Path: The specific location or resource on the server.
Query Parameters: Additional information appended to the URL.
Fragment: A specific section within a document.
Scheme for a HTTP URL: The scheme for a HTTP URL is typically "http" or "https," where "https" indicates a secure, encrypted connection.

Domain Name: A domain name is a human-readable address that corresponds to a specific IP address on the internet. It provides a way to identify and locate resources.

Sub-Domain: A sub-domain is a subset of a domain. For example, in "blog.example.com," "blog" is a sub-domain of "example.com."

Port Number in a URL: Port numbers are specified in a URL using a colon followed by the port number. For example, "http://example.com:8080" specifies port 8080.

Query String: The query string is a part of the URL that contains data to be passed to the server. It begins with a question mark and consists of key-value pairs (e.g., "?key1=value1&key2=value2").

HTTP Request: An HTTP request is a message sent by a client to request a specific action from a server. It includes the method (e.g., GET, POST), headers, and optional body content.

HTTP Response: An HTTP response is a message sent by a server in response to an HTTP request. It includes a status code, headers, and optional body content.

HTTP Headers: HTTP headers are metadata elements in an HTTP request or response that provide additional information about the message, such as the content type or length.

HTTP Message Body: The HTTP message body contains the content of the request or response. For example, in a POST request, the message body might contain form data.

HTTP Request Method: The HTTP request method defines the action to be performed by the request. Common methods include GET (retrieve data), POST (submit data), and DELETE (delete a resource).

HTTP Response Status Code: The HTTP response status code indicates the result of the request. For example, a status code of 200 means success, while 404 indicates not found.

HTTP Cookie: An HTTP cookie is a small piece of data stored on the user's device by the web browser. It is often used to remember information about the user, such as login credentials or preferences.

cURL: cURL is a command-line tool and library for transferring data with URLs. It supports various protocols, including HTTP, and is used to make requests from the command line.

Typing "google.com" in the Browser (Application Level): When you type "google.com" in your browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to the Google server. The server responds with an HTML document that the browser renders, displaying the Google homepage. This involves multiple HTTP requests for additional resources (CSS, JavaScript, images) and the execution of scripts to create the interactive Google search page.
