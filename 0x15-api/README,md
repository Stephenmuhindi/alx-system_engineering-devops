Bash scripting should not be used for:

Large-scale applications with complex logic: While Bash scripting is powerful for automating tasks and managing system configurations, it's not suitable for large and complex applications due to its limited capabilities and readability.
Performance-critical tasks: Bash scripting may not offer the performance required for tasks that involve heavy computation or processing large datasets. Other languages like C or Python would be more appropriate for such scenarios.
Cross-platform development: Bash scripting is inherently tied to Unix-like systems and may not be easily portable across different operating systems.
API (Application Programming Interface):

An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.
APIs can be used to integrate functionality from different sources, access data from external services, or enable interoperability between various software components.
REST API:

REST (Representational State Transfer) API is a type of web service that follows the principles of REST architectural style.
It uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.
REST APIs typically use JSON or XML as the data exchange format and are stateless, meaning each request from a client contains all the information necessary to process the request.
Microservices:

Microservices architecture is an approach to building software applications as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services.
Each service in a microservices architecture is focused on a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
Microservices communicate with each other through APIs and often use lightweight protocols like HTTP or messaging queues for inter-service communication.
CSV format:

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a plain text format used for storing tabular data.
Each line in a CSV file represents a row of data, with individual values separated by commas (or other delimiters like semicolons or tabs).
CSV is widely used for exchanging data between different software applications and can be easily processed using spreadsheet software or programming languages.
JSON format:

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format.
It is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
JSON is often used for transmitting data between a server and a web application, as well as for storing configuration data and transmitting data between microservices.
Pythonic Package and module name style:

Package and module names should be lowercase, with underscores as necessary to improve readability (e.g., my_package, my_module).
Pythonic Class name style:

Class names should follow the CapWords convention, also known as CamelCase, where each word within the name is capitalized (e.g., MyClass, MyOtherClass).
Pythonic Variable name style:

Variable names should be lowercase, with underscores as necessary to improve readability (e.g., my_variable, another_variable).
Pythonic Function name style:

Function names should be lowercase, with underscores as necessary to improve readability (e.g., my_function, another_function).
Pythonic Constant name style:

Constant names should be uppercase, with underscores as necessary to improve readability (e.g., MY_CONSTANT, ANOTHER_CONSTANT).
Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python:

CapWords or CamelCase convention is commonly used in Python for naming classes, exceptions, and constants. It helps improve the readability and clarity of code, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain Python projects. The convention involves capitalizing the first letter of each word in the name, without using underscores to separate words.
