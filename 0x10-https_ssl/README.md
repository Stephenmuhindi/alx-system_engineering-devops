HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are protocols used to secure communication over a computer network, typically the internet. SSL has been largely replaced by its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security), but the term SSL is still commonly used.

SSL's Two Main Roles in HTTPS:

Authentication: SSL/TLS ensures the identity of the server to the client and, optionally, the client to the server. This is achieved through the use of digital certificates, which are issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs). These certificates help establish the legitimacy of the parties involved in the communication.
Encryption: SSL/TLS encrypts the data exchanged between the client and the server. This encryption protects the information from being intercepted and read by unauthorized parties. It ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the data during transmission.
Purpose of Encrypting Traffic:

Confidentiality: Encryption ensures that the data exchanged between the client and the server remains confidential and cannot be easily understood if intercepted by malicious actors. This is particularly crucial when transmitting sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial details.

Integrity: Encryption also helps maintain the integrity of the data. Any tampering with the encrypted data would result in a change in the ciphertext, and the recipient can detect such alterations. This ensures that the data has not been manipulated during transit.

Authentication: While not a direct result of encryption, the use of digital certificates in the SSL/TLS handshake process helps authenticate the parties involved, adding an extra layer of security.

SSL Termination:

Definition: SSL termination refers to the process of decrypting the encrypted traffic at the point of entry into a network, typically at a load balancer or a reverse proxy server. After termination, the traffic continues its journey in an unencrypted form within the internal network.

Purpose: SSL termination is often used to offload the resource-intensive task of encryption from the web servers. The decryption happens at the termination point, and then the traffic is passed along in clear text within the secure internal network. This allows for more efficient use of resources on the web servers, as they don't have to handle the decryption process. It also facilitates easier monitoring and analysis of the unencrypted traffic within the internal network.
